# Pacman Project

The UC Berkeley Pac-Man projects are educational programming projects that are part of courses on artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning. In these projects, each of the studnet is tasked with implementing various AI algorithms and techniques to create intelligent agents that can control Pac-Man characters to achieve specific goals within the game.

The projects typically cover a range of AI topics, including search algorithms, adversarial search, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic reasoning. One learns to design and implement AI algorithms, apply them to solve problems in the context of the Pac-Man game, and gain hands-on experience in the field of AI and game development.
